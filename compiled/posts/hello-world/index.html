<p>Hello World (Hello Jello)</p>

<p>In order to create valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, you need properly
coded syntax that can be cumbersome for
&#8220;non-programmers&#8221; to write. Sometimes, you just want
to easily make certain words <strong>bold</strong>, and certain
words <em>italicized</em> without having to remember the
syntax. Additionally, for example, creating lists:</p>

<ul>
<li>should be easy</li>
<li>should not involve programming</li>
</ul>
